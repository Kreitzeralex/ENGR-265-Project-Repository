# ENGR-265-Project-Repository
## Overview of culminating projects from ENGR 265: Engineering Decision Making. 

### Covid-19 Data
This was the first culminating assignment which required parsing of the New York Times Covid-19 database and answering questions such as which 7-day period had the most Covid-19 cases in Harrisonburg City. All questions that were answered are written at the top of the Covid_19_Data.py script.
