# ENGR-265-Project-Repository
## Overview of culminating projects from ENGR 265: Engineering Decision Making. 

### Heartbeat Detection 
Raw heartbeat data is given and we were asked to count the number of heartbeats. I used a modified Pan-Tompkins Algorithm to filter the data along with the find peaks function found in the scipy library to determine the peaks which were the heartbeats. Below is the raw voltage data and then the final filtered result.

### Covid-19 Data
This was the first culminating assignment which required grabbing data from the New York Times Covid-19 database and answering questions such as which 7-day period had the most Covid-19 cases in Harrisonburg City. All questions that were answered are written at the top of the Covid_19_Data.py script.
